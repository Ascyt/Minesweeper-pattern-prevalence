# Minesweeper-pattern-prevalence
Runs Minesweeper simulations to see how often each patterns occur. The mine generation simply chooses a random pixel of the grid until it finds an empty one. output.txt was run on 1 million simulations with the values of expert minesweeper. 

The entire code is in program.cs. Change the values near the top of it to change the simulation.
